/* 1. Does sleep/mood correlate negatively with stress? (ex. good sleep = low stress, etc.) 
   2. Does stress have an effect on mood/sleep? 
   3. Are users with generally higher stress affected by the quality of their sleep? Same for low avg stress users.
   4. What is the frequency of users with good sleep and low rumination stress, but high anticipatory stress?
   5. What is the frequency of users with bad sleep and high rumination stress, but low anticipatory stress?
   6. Is there a clear independant factor? sleep/mood can affect stress levels, but stress levels can also affect sleep/mood.
